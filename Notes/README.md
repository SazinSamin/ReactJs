You should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state,
and context are the same. It also shouldnâ€™t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the 
browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount.
