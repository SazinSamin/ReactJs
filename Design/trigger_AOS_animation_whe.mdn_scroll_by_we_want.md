// To trigger the animation when only a specific section is visible on the website, you can use the Intersection Observer API. 
// This API allows you to detect when an element enters or exits the viewport.Here's an example of how you can modify your code
// to trigger the AOS animation when the section becomes visible:

```
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import Aos from "aos";
import "aos/dist/aos.css";

const HomePage = () => {
  const sectionRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      threshold: 0.2, // Adjust this threshold value as needed
    };

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          Aos.init({
            duration: 1000,
            easing: "ease-in-sine",
            delay: 10,
          });
        }
      });
    }, options);

    if (sectionRef.current) {
      observer.observe(sectionRef.current);
    }

    return () => {
      if (sectionRef.current) {
        observer.unobserve(sectionRef.current);
      }
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <div ref={sectionRef} data-aos="zoom-in">
        {/* Content of the section */}
      </div>
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```
// In this code, a sectionRef is created using the useRef hook to reference the section element that you want to observe. 
// The Intersection Observer API is used in the useEffect hook to detect when the section becomes visible.
// When the section intersects the viewport by the specified threshold (in this example, 20% of the section is visible), 
// the AOS animation is triggered.Make sure to adjust the threshold value to your desired visibility criteria. Additionally,
// ensure that the section you want to animate has the data-aos attribute with the desired AOS animation name.By using 
// the Intersection Observer API, you can trigger the AOS animation when the section is visible, providing a more precise 
// control over when the animation should occur.
