## From ChatGpt   
In the provided code snippet, the console.log(searchCountry) statement is logging the value of searchCountry immediately after
updating its state with setSearchCountry(e.target.value). However, due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React, 
the new value of searchCountry may not be available immediately after calling setSearchCountry.
The useState hook, in this case, sets the initial value of searchCountry to null. When handleChange is triggered by an input change, 
it updates the state by calling setSearchCountry(e.target.value). The state update is queued and will be processed by React at a
later time. If you want to see the updated value of searchCountry in the console.log, you can use the useEffect hook to monitor 
changes to the state and log the value when it changes. Here's an example:

```
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function Search() {
  const [searchCountry, setSearchCountry] = useState(null);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setSearchCountry(e.target.value);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(searchCountry);
  }, [searchCountry]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={handleChange} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
By including [searchCountry] as the second argument to useEffect, it will only execute the effect when searchCountry changes. 
This way, whenever searchCountry is updated, the new value will be logged in the console.
