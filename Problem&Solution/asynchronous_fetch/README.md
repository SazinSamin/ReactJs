## From chatgpt  
The code you provided seems to be a React component that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and sets the received data to 
the todos state variable. However, you mentioned that the todos response is null when you try to log it.
The reason for this behavior is that the setTodos function used in setTodos(json) is asynchronous, and its state update may 
not be immediately reflected when you log todos immediately after calling setTodos. React state updates are batched for
performance reasons, so the state variable might not have been updated yet when you log it.
If you want to see the updated value of todos, you can log it in the useEffect hook, after the state update has been applied.
Here's an updated version of your code:  

```
const fetchData = async () => {  
  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");  
  const json = await response.json();  
  setTodos(json);  
};  
  
useEffect(() => {  
  fetchData().then(() => {  
    console.log(todos); // Log the updated value of todos  
  });  
}, []); 
```


By logging todos inside the then block of the fetchData promise, 
you ensure that it will be logged after the state update has been applied. This way, you should see the correct value of todos.
