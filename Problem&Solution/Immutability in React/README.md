## Immutability in React: Ensuring Proper State Updates and Re-renders(from ChatGpt)  

Certainly! In React, state updates are based on immutability, which means that instead of directly modifying the existing state, you should create a new copy of the state with the desired changes.

When you mutate an array directly (as done with splice in your original code), you are modifying the original array in-place. This mutation can cause issues with React's ability to detect changes and trigger re-renders efficiently.

React performs a shallow comparison between the previous state and the new state to determine if a re-render is necessary. If the reference to the state object remains the same, React assumes that nothing has changed, even if the values within the state object have been modified.

By directly mutating the todos array with splice, you are modifying the original array in-place. As a result, the reference to the todos array remains the same, and React may not recognize the change. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the component not re-rendering as you expect.

To overcome this issue, it's recommended to create a new copy of the array with the desired modifications. This ensures that the reference to the state object changes, signaling to React that the state has been updated. In the updated code snippet, the line const updatedTodos = [...todos]; creates a new array updatedTodos by spreading the values from the existing todos array. This way, you have a new reference to a modified copy of the array.

By modifying the updatedTodos array instead of the original todos array and passing the new array to setTodos(updatedTodos), React recognizes the state update and triggers a re-render of the component with the updated array.
